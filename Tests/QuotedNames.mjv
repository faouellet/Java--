/*
** Test QuotedNames.mjv
**
** Sanity check on the jasmin version. This diagnose if
**  there are any problems with quoted names in .var and
**  .field directives...
**
** For field, declaring them is enough, since all fields
**  are initialized to their default values in the generated
**  code.
**
** Variables are never referred to by name in the generated
**  code (only by their index in the stack frame), so it is
**  enough if they do not generated a jasmin diagnostic and
**  that their field siblings are correctly recognized. So
**  this class has no executing code proper. If it compiles
**  OK in jasmin, and runs correctly in JVM (i.e. the class
**  inits and the verification process), it should be fine.
